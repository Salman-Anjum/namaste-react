#Parcel is a beast. It performs the following task

- Dev build
- Local Server
- HMR - Hot Module Replacement
- File Watching Algoritham
- Catching - Faster Builds
- Image Optimisation
- Minification
- Bundling
- Compress
- Consistent Hashing
- Code Splitting
- Differential Bundling - to support older browsers
- Diagnostic
- Error Handling
- HTTPs
- Tree Shaking - remove unused code
- Different development and production bundles
- Transpiling

#JSX is a JavaScript syntax which is easier to create React Elements
#JSX is not HTML inside JavaScript, it is HTML-like or XML-like syntax
#Whenever we write some code in JSX, Parcel (Babel) transpiles it before it reaches JS Engine
#Transpiling means JSX code gets converted into a code that our browsers & react can understand
#Parcel gives the reponsibility of Transpilation to a JS package, known as Babel
#Babel converts the JSX code to React.Element, which is a JS Object
#We have to use cameCase while giving attributues to JSX
#While writing more than one line of code in JSX, it is mandatory to wrap it in round brackets
#At the end of the day, JSX is a React Element
#JSX sanitizes the data coming from an API call, this saving us from becoming a target of an attacker/hacker
